<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  I've never actually made fried pantains. I've had them before though. When I
  was in middle school, the class had an event where we bring food from where
  we're from. My friend brought fried plantains; that's what made me think of
  this. That's not when I actually remember eating fried plantains though.
